# Git Push Manual Rule

## Context

Used when user indicates they want to update saved changes in git (commit etc)

## Critical Rules

- Run `git reset` first to clean the stage
- Run command `git add .` from the root of the workspace
- Review all added changes that will be included in the commit
- Split into several commits according to a subject (thematically fitting changes should be committed together)
- Use format for title: `type: brief description` - keep it brief and descriptive (max 72 chars)
- Add an empty line after commit title
- Include short paragraph summary of gist of what and why the change is being made
- Push all to the remote current branch

## Examples

<example>
git reset && git add SPECIFIC-FILE1 file2 && git commit -m "[FEATURE] Add Cursor rules and templates" -m "" -m "- Added comprehensive set of Cursor rules for AI assistance" -m "- Introduced new templates for architecture, PRD, and stories" -m "- Added `.gitignore` rules for the new files"
</example>
